# SMTk - Starbound Mod Toolkit

SMTk is a collection of tools to assist with building mods quickly and effectively.  Included are several utilities:

* JSON validation (special for Starbound JSON files)
* JSON Patch builder
* PNG Asset compressor
* Starbound mod pak builder

SMTk is currently only available for Windows. A comparable script may be written for Linux at some point in the future (obviously not in batch).

SMTk is licensed under the MIT license.  A copy of the license is also embedded into the buildpak.bat file header comments.

## Installation

*Please note that the following directions are Windows-specific and may need to be adapted to suit your environment.*

### Humble Store users

Those who have Starbound installed via the Humble Store copy will have to set the STARBOUND_PATH env variable or add their Starbound copy's installation location to the system PATH, as there is no viable way to automatically locate Starbound for Humble Store installations - it just can't be done.

Just set the STARBOUND_PATH environment variable to the root directory of your Starbound installation and you're good to go.
